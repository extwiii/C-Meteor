    <p>Hello</p> 
    <p>
      This is a music machine, developed according to the specifications given on <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-website-examples/peer/Strsh/responsive-website-tutorial-and-examples-peer-review-1">this page</a> -- namely:
      
      <ol><li>Clear navigation allowing the user to move between pages and locate relevant information</li><li>Consistent style across the pages through the use of CSS</li><li>Responsive layout where the layout changes depending on the size of the browser window</li><li>Use of Bootstrap</li><li>Clearly stated purpose for each page</li><li>Clear landing page (this page :-)</li><li>At least 8 different tracks of audio and at least 2 sliders per track, mapped to 2 specific audio features. </li></ol>      
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    
    <p>
      To give it a go, go to the <a href="/playground">playground</a>, turn on the DAC, and play around with the tracks.
    </p>

    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>
      Also, have a friend connect from another browser window and make music collaboratively! (Your actions will be instantly shared, except for controlling the DAC which is local to each user).
    </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>
      Finally, if you want to use your own sounds, simply place them somewhere in the public/samples directory of the app. The server automatically adds any .wav files it finds there when it starts.
    </p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p>
      Hope you enjoy it.. Have fun!
    </p>
