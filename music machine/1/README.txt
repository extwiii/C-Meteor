This is a music machine, developed according to the specifications given on this[1] page -- namely:

 1. Clear navigation allowing the user to move between pages and locate relevant information
 2. Consistent style across the pages through the use of CSS
 3. Responsive layout where the layout changes depending on the size of the browser window
 4. Use of Bootstrap
 5. Clearly stated purpose for each page
 6. Clear landing page
 7. At least 8 different tracks of audio and at least 2 sliders per track, mapped to 2 specific audio features.
 

To give it a go, go to the Playground page, turn on the DAC, and play around with the tracks.

Also, have a friend connect from another browser window and make music collaboratively! (Your actions will be instantly shared, except for controlling the DAC which is local to each user).
 
Finally, if you want to use your own sounds, simply place them somewhere in the public/samples directory of the app. The server automatically adds any .wav files it finds there when it starts.

Hope you enjoy it.. Have fun!


Technical small-print:

 - JS libraries used: maxim.js
 - Meteor packages used: es5-shim, ecmascript, iron:router, twbs:bootstrap, random, jiku:bootstrap-toggle, fortawesome:fontawesome
