          SoundBox is more of a sonic exploratory project.
          It is collaborative in that two or more people can affect the sounds in real-time.
          So you can discover interesting possibilities while playing with your friends (or strangers!).
          There are no track hierarchies that are referent-bound or idiomatic.
          Simply experiment with the available sounds and, hopefully, have fun.
          Navigate to "Workspace" to get started.
